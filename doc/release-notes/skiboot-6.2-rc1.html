<p>skiboot v6.2-rc1 was released on Monday November 19th 2018. It is the first
release candidate of skiboot 6.2, which will become the new stable release
of skiboot following the 6.1 release, first released July 11th 2018.</p>
<p>Skiboot 6.2 will mark the basis for op-build v2.2.</p>
<p>skiboot v6.2-rc1 contains all bug fixes as of <a class="reference internal" href="skiboot-6.0.13.html#skiboot-6-0-13"><span class="std std-ref">skiboot-6.0.13</span></a>,
and <a class="reference internal" href="skiboot-5.4.10.html#skiboot-5-4-10"><span class="std std-ref">skiboot-5.4.10</span></a> (the currently maintained
stable releases).</p>
<p>For how the skiboot stable releases work, see <a class="reference internal" href="../process/stable-skiboot-rules.html#stable-rules"><span class="std std-ref">Skiboot stable tree rules and releases</span></a> for details.</p>
<p>This release has been a longer cycle than typical for a variety of reasons. It
also contains a lot of cleanup work and minor bug fixes (much like skiboot 6.1
did).</p>
<p>Over skiboot 6.1, we have the following changes:</p>
<section id="general">
<h2>General<a class="headerlink" href="#general" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>cpu: Quieten OS endian switch messages</p>
<p>Users see these when loading an OS from Petitboot:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which is expected and doesn’t provide any information the user can act
on. Switch them to PR_INFO so they still appear in the log, but not on
the serial console.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Recognise signed VERSION partition</p>
<p>A few things need to change to support a signed VERSION partition:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A signed VERSION partition will be 4K + SECURE_BOOT_HEADERS_SIZE (4K).</p></li>
<li><p>The VERSION partition needs to be loaded after secure/trusted boot is
set up, and therefore after nvram_init().</p></li>
<li><p>Added to the trustedboot resources array.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This also moves the ipmi_dt_add_bmc_info() call to after
flash_dt_add_fw_version() since it adds info to ibm,firmware-versions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run pollers in time_wait() when not booting</p>
<p>This only bit us hard with hiomap in one scenario.</p>
<p>Our OPAL API has been OPAL_POLL_EVENTS may be needed to make forward
progress on ongoing operations, and the internal to skiboot API has been
that time_wait() of a suitable time will run pollers (on at least one
CPU) to help ensure forward progress can be made.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, interrupts are used but they may: a) be disabled, or
b) the thing we’re doing can’t use interrupts because computers are
generally terrible.</p>
<p>Back in 3db397ea5892a (circa 2015), we changed skiboot so that we’d run
pollers only on the boot CPU, and not if we held any locks. This was to
reduce the chance of programming code that could deadlock, as well as to
ensure that we didn’t just thrash all the cachelines for running pollers
all over a large system during boot, or hard spin on the same locks on
all secondary CPUs.</p>
<p>The problem arises if the OS we’re booting makes an OPAL call early on,
with interrupts disabled, that requires a poller to run to make forward
progress. An example of this would be OPAL_WRITE_NVRAM early in Linux
boot (where Linux sets up the partitions it wants) - something that
occurs iff we’ve had to reformat NVRAM this boot (i.e. first boot or
corrupted NVRAM).</p>
<p>The hiomap implementation should arguably <em>not</em> rely on synchronous IPMI
messages, but this is a future improvement (as was for mbox before it).
The mbox-flash code solved this problem by spinning on check_timers().</p>
<p>More generically though, the approach of running the pollers when no
longer booting means we behave more in line with what the API is meant
to be, rather than have this odd case of “time_wait() for a condition
that could also be tripped by an interrupt works fine unless the OS is
up and running but hasn’t set interrupts up yet”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ipmi: Reduce ipmi_queue_msg_sync() polling loop time to 10ms</p>
<p>On a plain boot, this reduces the time spent in OPAL by ~170ms on
p9dsu. This is due to hiomap (currently) using synchronous IPMI
messages.</p>
<p>It will also <em>significantly</em> reduce latency on runtime flash
operations for hiomap, as we’ll spend typically 10-20ms in OPAL
rather than 100-200ms. It’s not an ideal solution to that, but
it’s a quick and obvious win for jitter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>core/device: NULL pointer dereference fix</p></li>
<li><p>core/flash: NULL pointer dereference fixes</p></li>
<li><p>core/cpu: Call memset with proper cpu_thread offset</p></li>
<li><p>libflash: Add ipmi-hiomap, and prefer it for PNOR access</p>
<p>ipmi-hiomap implements the PNOR access control protocol formerly known
as “the mbox protocol” but uses IPMI instead of the AST LPC mailbox as a
transport. As there is no-longer any mailbox involved in this alternate
implementation the old protocol name is quite misleading, and so it has
been renamed to “the hiomap protoocol” (Host I/O Mapping protocol). The
same commands and events are used though this client-side implementation
assumes v2 of the protocol is supported by the BMC.</p>
<p>The code is a heavily-reworked copy of the mbox-flash source and is
introduced this way to allow for the mbox implementation’s eventual
removal.</p>
<p>mbox-flash should in theory be renamed to mbox-hiomap for consistency,
but as it is on life-support effective immediately we may as well just
remove it entirely when the time is right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>opal/hmi: Handle early HMIs on thread0 when secondaries are still in OPAL.</p>
<p>When primary thread receives a CORE level HMI for timer facility errors
while secondaries are still in OPAL, thread 0 ends up in rendez-vous
waiting for secondaries to get into hmi handling. This is because OPAL
runs with MSR(EE=0) and hence HMIs are delayed on secondary threads until
they are given to Linux OS. Fix this by adding a check for secondary
state and force them in hmi handling by queuing job on secondary threads.</p>
<p>I have tested this by injecting HDEC parity error very early during Linux
kernel boot. Recovery works fine for non-TB errors. But if TB is bad at
this very eary stage we already doomed.</p>
<p>Without this patch we see:</p>

<li><p>core/cpu: Fix memory allocation for job array</p>
<p>fixes: 7a3f307e core/cpu: parallelise global CPU register setting jobs</p>
<p>This bug would result in boot-hang on some configurations due to
cpu_wait_job() endlessly waiting for the last bogus jobs[cpu-&gt;pir] pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>i2c: Fix multiple-enqueue of the same request on NACK</p>
<p>i2c_request_send() will retry the request if the error is a NAK,
however it forgets to clear the “ud.done” flag. It will thus
loop again and try to re-enqueue the same request causing internal
request list corruption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>i2c: Ensure ordering between i2c_request_send() and completion</p>
<p>i2c_request_send loops waiting for a flag “uc.done” set by
the completion routine, and then look for a result code
also set by that same completion.</p>
<p>There is no synchronization, the completion can happen on another
processor, so we need to order the stores to uc and the reads
from uc so that uc.done is stored last and tested first using
memory barriers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>pci: Clarify power down logic</p>
<p>Currently pci_scan_bus() unconditionally calls pci_slot_set_power_state()
when it’s finished scanning a bus. This is one of those things that
makes you go “WHAT?” when you first see it and frankly the skiboot PCI
code could do with less of that.</p>

<li><p>fast-reboot: parallel memory clearing</p>
<p>Arbitrarily pick 16GB as the unit of parallelism, and
split up clearing memory into jobs and schedule them
node-local to the memory (or on node 0 if we can’t
work that out because it’s the memory up to SKIBOOT_BASE)</p>
<p>This seems to cut at least ~40% time from memory zeroing on
fast-reboot on a 256GB Boston system.</p>
<p>For many systems, scanning PCI takes about as much time as
zeroing all of RAM, so we may as well do them at the same time
and cut a few seconds off the total fast reboot time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>fast-reboot: verify firmware “romem” checksum</p>
<p>This takes a checksum of skiboot memory after boot that should be
unchanged during OS operation, and verifies it before allowing a
fast reboot.</p>
<p>This is not read-only memory from skiboot’s point of view, beause
it includes things like the opal branch table that gets populated
during boot.</p>
<p>This helps to improve the integrity of firmware against host and
runtime firmware memory scribble bugs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>core/fast-reboot: print the fast reboot disable reason</p>
<p>Once things start to go wrong, disable_fast_reboot can be called a
number of times, so make the first reason sticky, and also print it
to the console at disable time. This helps with making sense of
fast reboot disables.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add fast-reboot property to /ibm,opal DT node</p>
<p>this means that if it’s permanently disabled on boot, the test suite can
pick that up and not try a fast reboot test.</p>

<p>As per ABIv2 : “r12 : Function entry address at global entry point”</p>

<ul>
<li><p>core/lock: Use try_lock_caller() in lock_caller() to capture owner</p>
<p>Otherwise we can get reports of core/lock.c owning the lock, which is
not helpful when tracking down ownership issues.</p>
</li>
<li><p>core/flash: Emit a warning if Skiboot version doesn’t match</p>
<p>This means you’ll get a warning that you’ve modified skiboot separately
to the rest of the PNOR image, which can be useful in determining what
firmware is actually running on a machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>gcov: link in ctors* as newer GCC doesn’t group them all</p>
<p>It seems that newer toolchains get us multiple ctors sections to link in
rather than just one. If we discard them (as we were doing), then we
don’t have a working gcov build (and we get the “doesn’t look sane”
warning on boot).</p>
</li>
<li><p>core/flash: Log return code when ffs_init() fails</p>

<li><p>travis/ci: rework Dockerfiles to produce build artifacts</p>

</li>
<li><p>cpu: add cpu_queue_job_on_node()</p>
<p>Add a job scheduling API which will run the job on the requested
chip_id (or return failure).</p>
</li>
<li><p>opal-ci: Build old dtc version for fedora 28</p>
<p>There are patches that will go into dtc to fix the issues we hit, but
for the moment let’s just build and use a slightly older version.</p>
</li>
<li><p>mem_region: Merge similar allocations when dumping</p>
<p>Currently we print one line for each allocation done at runtime when
dumping the memory allocations. We do a few thousand allocations at
boot so this can result in a huge amount of text being printed which
is a) slow to print, and b) Can result in the log buffer overflowing
which destroys otherwise useful information.</p>
<p>This patch adds a de-duplication to this memory allocation dump by
merging “similar” allocations (same location, same size) into one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the algorithm used to do the de-duplication is quadratic,
but considering we only dump the allocations in the event of a fatal
error I think this is acceptable. I also did some benchmarking and found
that on a ZZ it takes ~3ms to do a dump with 12k allocations. On a Zaius
it’s slightly longer at about ~10ms for 10k allocs. However, the
difference there was due to the output being written to the UART.</p>
<p>This patch also bumps the log level to PR_NOTICE. PR_INFO messages are
suppressed at the default log level, which probably isn’t something you
want considering we only dump the allocations when we run out of skiboot
heap space.</p>
</li>
<li><p>core/lock: fix timeout warning causing a deadlock false positive</p>
<p>If a lock waiter exceeds the warning timeout, it prints a message
while still registered as requesting the lock. Printing the message
can take locks, so if one is held when the owner of the original
lock tries to print a message, it will get a false positive deadlock
detection, which brings down the system.</p>
<p>This can easily be hit when there is a lot of HMI activity from a
KVM guest, where the timebase was not returned to host timebase
before calling the HMI handler.</p>
</li>
<li><p>hw/p8-i2c: Print the set error bits</p>
<p>This is purely to save me from having to look it up every time someone
gets an I2C error.</p>
</li>
<li><p>init: Fix starting stripped kernel</p>
<p>Currently if we try to run a raw/stripped binary kernel (ie. without
the elf header) we crash with:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[    0.008757768,5] INIT: Waiting for kernel...

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is because we haven’t set kernel_entry correctly in this path.
This fixes it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>cpu: Better output when waiting for a very long job</p>
<p>Instead of printing at the end if the job took more than 1s,
print in the loop every 30s along with a backtrace. This will
give us some output if the job is deadlocked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>lock: Fix interactions between lock dependency checker and stack checker</p>
<p>The lock dependency checker does a few nasty things that can cause
re-entrancy deadlocks in conjunction with the stack checker or
in fact other debug tests.</p>
<p>A lot of it revolves around taking a new lock (dl_lock) as part
of the locking process.</p>
<p>This tries to fix it by making sure we do not hit the stack
checker while holding dl_lock.</p>
<p>We achieve that in part by directly using the low-level __try_lock
and manually unlocking on the dl_lock, and making some functions
“nomcount”.</p>
<p>In addition, we mark the dl_lock as being in the console path to
avoid deadlocks with the UART driver.</p>
<p>We move the enabling of the deadlock checker to a separate config
option from DEBUG_LOCKS as well, in case we chose to disable it
by default later on.</p>

<p>When stop state 5 is enabled, reading the core_fir during an HMI can
result in a xscom read error with xscom_read() returning an
OPAL_XSCOM_PARTIAL_GOOD error code and core_fir value of all FFs. At
present this return error code is not handled in decode_core_fir()
hence the invalid core_fir value is sent to the kernel where it
interprets it as a FATAL hmi causing a system check-stop.</p>
<p>This can be prevented by forcing the core to wake-up using before

read_core_fir() within calls to dctl_set_special_wakeup() and

<h3>PHB4<a class="headerlink" href="#phb4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>phb4: Generate checkstop on AIB ECC corr/uncorr for DD2.0 parts</p>
<p>On DD2.0 parts, PCIe ECC protection is not warranted in the response
data path. Thus, for these parts, we need to flag any ECC errors
detected from the adjacent AIB RX Data path so the part can be
replaced.</p>
<p>This patch configures the FIRs so that we escalate these AIB ECC
errors to a checkstop so the parts can be replaced.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Reset pfir and nfir if new errors reported during ETU reset</p>
<p>During fast-reboot new PEC errors can be latched even after ETU-Reset
is asserted. This will result in values of variables nfir_cache and
pfir_cache to be out of sync.</p>
<p>During step-2 of CRESET nfir_cache and pfir_cache values are used to
bring the PHB out of reset state. However if these variables are out
as noted above of date the nfir/pfir registers are never reset
completely and ETU still remains frozen.</p>
<p>Hence this patch updates step-2 of phb4_creset to re-read the values of
nfir/pfir registers to check if any new errors were reported after
ETU-reset was asserted, report these new errors and reset the
nfir/pfir registers. This should bring the ETU out of reset
successfully.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Disable nodal scoped DMA accesses when PB pump mode is enabled</p>
<p>By default when a PCIe device issues a read request via the PHB it is first
issued with nodal scope. When accessing GPU memory the NPU does not know at the
time of response if the requested memory page is off node or not. Therefore
every read of GPU memory by a PHB is retried with larger scope which introduces
bandwidth and latency issues.</p>
<p>On smaller boxes which have pump mode enabled nodal and group scoped reads are
treated the same and both types of request are broadcast to one chip. Therefore
we can avoid the retry by disabling nodal scope on the PHB for these boxes. On
larger boxes nodal (single chip) and group (multiple chip) scoped reads are
treated differently. Therefore we avoid disabling nodal scope on large boxes
which have pump mode disabled to avoid all PHB requests being broadcast to
multiple chips.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4/capp: Only reset FIR bits that cause capp machine check</p>
<p>During CAPP recovery do_capp_recovery_scoms() will reset the CAPP Fir
register just after CAPP recovery is completed. This has an
unintentional side effect of preventing PRD from analyzing and
reporting this error. If PRD tries to read the CAPP FIR after opal has
already reset it, then it logs a critical error complaining “No active
error bits found”.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening we update do_capp_recovery_scoms() to
only reset fir bits that cause CAPP machine check (local xstop). This
is done by reading the CAPP Fir Action0/1 &amp; Mask registers and
generating a mask which is then written on CAPP_FIR_CLEAR register.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Check for RX errors after link training</p>
<p>Some PHB4 PHYs can get stuck in a bad state where they are constantly
retraining the link. This happens transparently to skiboot and Linux
but will causes PCIe to be slow. Resetting the PHB4 clears the
problem.</p>
<p>We can detect this case by looking at the RX errors count where we
check for link stability. This patch does this by modifying the link
optimal code to check for RX errors. If errors are occurring we
retrain the link irrespective of the chip rev or card.</p>
<p>Normally when this problem occurs, the RX error count is maxed out at
255. When there is no problem, the count is 0. We chose 8 as the max
rx errors value to give us some margin for a few errors. There is also
a knob that can be used to set the error threshold for when we should
retrain the link. ie</p>

</div>
</li>
<li><p>hw/phb4: Add a helper to dump the PELT-V</p>
<p>The “Partitionable Endpoint Lookup Table (Vector)” is used by the PHB
when processing EEH events. The PELT-V defines which PEs should be
additionally frozen in the event of an error being flagged on a
given PE. Knowing the state of the PELT-V is sometimes useful for
debugging PHB issues so this patch adds a helper to dump it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>hw/phb4: Print the PEs in the EEH dump in hex</p>
<p>Linux always displays the PE number in hexidecimal while skiboot
displays the PEST index (PE number) in decimal. This makes correlating
errors between Skiboot and Linux more annoying than it should be so
this patch makes Skiboot print the PEST number in hex.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Reallocate PEC2 DMA-Read engines to improve GPU-Direct bandwidth</p>
<p>We reallocate additional 16/8 DMA-Read engines allocated to stack0/1
on PEC2 respectively. This is needed to improve bandwidth available to
the Mellanox CX5 adapter when trying to read GPU memory (GPU-Direct).</p>
<p>If kernel cxl driver indicates a request to allocate maximum possible
DMA read engines when calling enable_capi_mode() and card is attached
to PEC2/stack0 slot then we assume its a Mellanox CX5 adapter. We then
allocate additional 16/8 extra DMA read engines to stack0 and stack1
respectively on PEC2. This is done by populating the
XPEC_PCI_PRDSTKOVR and XPEC_NEST_READ_STACK_OVERRIDE as suggested by
the h/w team.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Enable PHB MMIO-0/1 Bars only when mmio window exists</p>
<p>Presently phb4_probe_stack() will always enable PHB MMIO0/1 windows
even if they doesn’t exist in phy_map. Hence we do some minor shuffling
in the phb4_probe_stack() so that MMIO-0/1 Bars are only enabled if
there corresponding MMIO window exists in the phy_map. In case phy_map
for an mmio window is ‘0’ we set the corresponding BAR register to
‘0’.</p>
</li>
<li><p>hw/phb4: Use local_alloc for phb4 structures</p>
<p>Struct phb4 is fairly heavyweight at 283664 bytes. On systems with
6x PHBs per socket this results in using 3.2MB of heap space the PHB
structures alone. This is a fairly large chunk of our 12MB heap and
on systems with particularly large PCIe topologies, or additional
PHBs we can fail to boot because we cannot allocate space for the
FDT blob.</p>
<p>This patch switches to using local_alloc() for the PHB structures
so they don’t consume too large a portion of our 12MB heap space.</p>

<li><p>phb4: Don’t probe a PHB if its garded</p>
<p>Presently phb4_probe_stack() causes an exception while trying to probe
a PHB if its garded. This causes skiboot to go into a reboot loop with
following exception log:</p>

</div>
<p>This is caused as phb4_probe_stack() will ignore all xscom read/write
errors to enable PHB Bars and then tries to perform an mmio to read
PHB Version registers that cause the fatal MCE.</p>
<p>We fix this by ignoring the PHB probe if the first xscom_write() to
populate the PHB Bar register fails, which indicates that there is
something wrong with the PHB.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Workaround PHB errata with CFG write UR/CA errors</p>
<p>If the PHB encounters a UR or CA status on a CFG write, it will
incorrectly freeze the wrong PE. Instead of using the PE# specified
in the CONFIG_ADDRESS register, it will use the PE# of whatever
MMIO occurred last.</p>
<p>Work around this disabling freeze on such errors</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Handle allocation errors in phb4_eeh_dump_regs()</p>
<p>If the zalloc fails (and it can be a rather large allocation),
we will overwite memory at 0 instead of failing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Don’t try to access non-existent PEST entries</p>
<p>In a POWER9 chip, some PHB4s have 256 PEs, some have 512.</p>
<p>Currently, the diagnostics code retrieves 512 unconditionally,
which is wrong and causes us to incorrectly report bogus values
for the “high” PEs on the small PHBs.</p>
<p>Use the actual number of implemented PEs instead</p>

<ul>
<li><p>phb4/capp: Use link width to allocate STQ engines to CAPP</p>
<p>Update phb4_init_capp_regs() to allocates STQ Engines to CAPP/PEC2
based on link width instead of always assuming it to x8.</p>
<p>Also re-factor the function slightly to evaluate the link-width only
once and cache it so that it can also be used to allocate DMA read
engines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4/capp: Update DMA read engines set in APC_FSM_READ_MASK based on link-width</p>
<p>Commit 47c09cdfe7a3(“phb4/capp: Calculate STQ/DMA read engines based
on link-width for PEC”) update the CAPP init sequence by calculating
the needed STQ/DMA-read engines based on link width and populating it
in XPEC_NEST_CAPP_CNTL register. This however needs to be synchronized
with the value set in CAPP APC FSM Read Machine Mask Register.</p>
<p>Hence this patch update phb4_init_capp_regs() to calculate the link
width of the stack on PEC2 and populate the same values as previously
populated in PEC CAPP_CNTL register.</p>
</li>
<li><p>capp: Fix the capp recovery timeout comparison</p>
<p>The current capp recovery timeout control loop in
do_capp_recovery_scoms() uses a wrong comparison for return value of
tb_compare(). This may cause do_capp_recovery_scoms() to report an
timeout earlier than the 168ms stipulated time.</p>
<p>The patch fixes this by updating the loop timeout control branch in
do_capp_recovery_scoms() to use the correct enum tb_cmpval.</p>
</li>
<li><p>phb4: Disable 32-bit MSI in capi mode</p>
<p>If a capi device does a DMA write targeting an address lower than 4GB,
it does so through a 32-bit operation, per the PCI spec. In capi mode,
the first TVE entry is configured in bypass mode, so the address is
valid. But with any (bad) luck, the address could be 0xFFFFxxxx, thus
looking like a 32-bit MSI.</p>
<p>We currently enable both 32-bit and 64-bit MSIs, so the PHB will
interpret the DMA write as a MSI, which very likely results in an EEH
(MSI with a bad payload size).</p>
<p>We can fix it by disabling 32-bit MSI when switching the PHB to capi
mode. Capi devices are 64-bit.</p>

<li><p>npu2: Add support for relaxed-ordering mode</p>
<p>Some device drivers support out of order access to GPU memory. This does
not affect the CPU view of memory but it does affect the GPU view of
memory. It should only be enabled if the GPU driver has requested it.</p>
<p>Add OPAL APIs allowing the driver to query relaxed ordering state or
request it to be set for a device. Current hardware only allows relaxed
ordering to be enabled per PCIe root port. So the code here doesn’t
enable relaxed ordering until it has been explicitly requested for every
device on the port.</p>

<li><p>npu2/hw-procedures: Don’t open code NPU2_NTL_MISC_CFG2_BRICK_ENABLE</p>

<p>Enable these error checking features by setting the appropriate bits in

<p>kill_type is enum of OPAL_PCI_TCE_KILL_PAGES, OPAL_PCI_TCE_KILL_PE,
OPAL_PCI_TCE_KILL_ALL and phb4_tce_kill() gets it right but

<li><p>Support OpenCAPI on Witherspoon platform</p></li>
<li><p>npu2-opencapi: Enable presence detection on ZZ</p>
<p>Presence detection for opencapi adapters was broken for ZZ planars v3
and below. All ZZ systems currently used in the lab have had their
planar upgraded, so we can now remove the override we had to force
presence and activate presence detection. Which should improve boot
time.</p>
<p>Considering the state of opal support on ZZ, this is really only for
lab usage on BML. The opencapi enablement team has okay’d the
change. In the unlikely case somebody tries opencapi on an old ZZ, the
presence detection through i2c will show that no adapter is present
and skiboot won’t try to access or train the link.</p>
</li>
<li><p>npu2-opencapi: Don’t send commands to NPU when link is down</p>
<p>Even if an opencapi link is down, we currently always try to issue a
config read operation when probing for PCI devices, because of the
default scan map used for an opencapi PHB. The config operation fails,
as expected, but it can also raise a FIR bit and trigger an HMI.</p>
<p>For opencapi, there’s no root device like for a “normal” PCI PHB, so
there’s no reason to do the config operation. To fix it, we keep the
scan map blank by default, and only add a device once the link is
trained.</p>
</li>
<li><p>opal/hmi: Catch NPU2 HMIs for opencapi</p>
<p>HMIs for NPU2 are filtered with the ‘compatible’ string of the PHB, so
add opencapi to the mix.</p>
</li>
<li><p>occ: Wait if OCC GPU presence status not immediately available</p>
<p>It takes a few seconds for the OCC to set everything up in order to read
GPU presence. At present, we try to kick off OCC initialisation as early as
possible to maximise the time it has to read GPU presence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately sometimes that’s not enough, so add a loop in
occ_get_gpu_presence() so that on the first time we try to get GPU presence
we keep trying for up to 2 seconds. Experimentally this seems to be
adequate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>hw/npu2-hw-procedures: Enable RX auto recal on OpenCAPI links</p>
<p>The RX_RC_ENABLE_AUTO_RECAL flag is required on OpenCAPI but not NVLink.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Hostboot sets this value according to the machine type.
However, now that Witherspoon supports both NVLink and OpenCAPI, it can’t
tell whether or not a link is OpenCAPI.</p>
<p>So instead, set it in skiboot, where it will only be triggered after we’ve
done device detection and found an OpenCAPI device.</p>
</li>
<li><p>hw/npu2-opencapi: Fix setting of supported OpenCAPI templates</p>
<p>In opal_npu_tl_set(), we made a typo that means the OPAL_NPU_TL_SET call
may not clear the enable bits for templates that were previously enabled
but are now disabled.</p>
<p>Fix the typo so we clear NPU2_OTL_CONFIG1_TX_TEMP2_EN as well as

<li><p>zaius: Add slots for the Barreleye G2 HDD rack</p>
<p>The Barreleye G2 is distinct from the Zaius in that it features a 24
Bay NVMe/SATA HDD rack. To provide meaningful slot names for each NVMe
device we need to define a slot table for the NVMe capable HDD bays.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this isn’t straightforward because the PCIe path to the
NVMe devices isn’t fixed. The PCIe topology is something like:
P9 -&gt; HBA card -&gt; 9797 switch -&gt; 20x NVMe HDD slots</p>
<p>The 9797 switch is partitioned into two (or four) virtual switches which
allow multiple HBA cards to be used (e.g. one per socket). As a result
the exact BDFN of the ports will vary depending on how the system is
configured.</p>
<p>That said, the virtual switch configuration of the 9797 does not change
the device and function numbers of the switch downports. This means that
we can define a single slot table that maps switch ports to the NVMe bay
names.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we still need to guess which bus to use this table on, so
we assume that any switch downport we find with the PEX9797 VDID is part
of the 9797 that supports the HDD rack.</p>

<li><p>platforms/astbmc/witherspoon: Implement OpenCAPI support</p>
<p>OpenCAPI on Witherspoon is slightly more involved than on Zaius and ZZ, due
to the OpenCAPI links using the SXM2 connectors that are used for NVLink
GPUs.</p>
<p>This patch adds the regular OpenCAPI platform information, and also a
Witherspoon-specific presence detection callback that uses the previously
added OCC GPU presence detection to figure out the device types plugged
into each SXM2 socket.</p>
<p>The SXM2 connectors are capable of carrying 2 OpenCAPI links, and future
OpenCAPI devices are expected to make use of this. However, we don’t yet
support ganged links and the various implications that has for handling
things like device reset, so for now, we only enable 1 brick per device.</p>
